This project demonstrates a scalable and efficient Selenium automation framework built with Python, Pytest, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The test suite is designed for the nopCommerce demo website and focuses on achieving quick, reliable automation with minimal setup effort.

The framework highlights:

- Rapid setup and execution of browser-based automated tests using Selenium and Pytest

- Page Object Model implementation for better maintainability, readability, and reusability

- Data-driven testing to validate multiple scenarios and inputs using external test data

- A clean, modular structure that can be easily extended for additional test coverage

This project serves as a practical guide for anyone looking to understand how quickly a Python-based Selenium framework can be created and how effectively it can be used to automate real-world test scenarios.
